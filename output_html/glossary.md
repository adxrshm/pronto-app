[smart text](javascript:void(0);)

In the Maintenance Management module, this is a function that allows text to be entered in a particular format that is detected by the system during work order completion.
During this process responses are required to the Smart Text questions. The system looks for a particular pattern in the text :\_\_\_ . This pattern can be entered on the work order text but is usually stored on the PM task as a template for the work orders requiring this function.

[smoothed error](javascript:void(0);)

In Advanced Forecasting, items with badly behaved data patterns can produce an erratic display of errors. An error being behaviour that is outside the expected range. As for trends, the erratic errors can be smoothed to reduce the abnormal peaks and troughs. This method would not be applied to well-behaved products where the errors would be considered normal.

[smoothed trend](javascript:void(0);)

For items with badly behaved data patterns in Advanced Forecasting, Pronto Xi works with the 3-month moving average in place of the actual sales data. That is, the value used for the sales in any period is the average of the sales in that period, the sales in the preceding period and the sales in the following period. This has the effect of 'smoothing' the sales data by reducing abnormal peaks and troughs.

[SOA](javascript:void(0);)

[STKTAKE](javascript:void(0);)

A predefined location name used within the Warehouse Management System module. When the Stocktake Prepare function identifies an imbalance between the stock on hand value and the aggregate quantity from the stock location records for an item, it inserts a location record with this code to balance the stock on hand. After the stock take update, the STKTAKE record is removed and the stock on hand for the locations are written as recorded in the counts. The STKTAKE location is therefore only visible between the stocktake prepare and update stock processes.

Areas can be defined according to the machinery used within that area, the type of stock held, stock storage requirements or the level of picking that occurs. Zones are used primarily for picking stock, not for stock putaway.

[ZROUND](javascript:void(0);)

The ZROUND occurs when the total price of a kit is different to the sum of the kit item prices. The kit is sold at the kit price and the difference is divided pro rata between the kit items, so that the items add up to the kit on the sales order. After the pro rata of the difference, there could still be a (small) difference left and this is the ZROUND amount. This amount is placed in a sales order line with an item code of ZROUND. This item is always placed directly below the kit item on the sales order and has a price of the lowest value for the currency used.

[ZROUNDDISC](javascript:void(0);)
