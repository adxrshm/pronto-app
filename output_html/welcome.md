* Pronto Software does not provide procedural manuals or work instructions due to the complex and differing nature of business models that Pronto Xi supports.
* Permission is granted for information to be copied from the Online Help for the express purpose of writing site-specific procedures or work instructions. The Online Help is also provided in Microsoft Word format on the Pronto Xi release DVD for this purpose.
* The Pronto Xi Software Development Kit (SDK) provides an easily accessible repository of technical and solution crafting knowledge which can be shared and contributed to by the entire Pronto Xi user community. The SDK documentation is not included as part of the Pronto Xi Online Help library, but can be installed separately from the Pronto Xi release DVD.
