# Budgeting

Pronto Xi provides three distinct budgeting capabilities:

* GL budgets

  The GL budget functions provide a simple, flexible and intuitive financial budgeting solution.
  There are an unlimited number of budgets available, as well as a range of sophisticated tools, including the ability to combine actuals into an adjusted budget forecast.
* Configurable budgets

  The configurable budget functions allow you to create a three level budget combining attributes from the customer master and inventory master.

  Budgets can be maintained by customer, and these budgets can then be aggregated and used to drive [Material Requirements Planning](javascript:void(0);)Material Requirements Planning. Used to ensure that all materials required for the planned production are available when needed, and can reschedule planned production until materials are available. MRP can automatically raise orders to produce these components if manufactured components are in short supply. ([MRP](javascript:void(0);)Material Requirements Planning.

MRP can automatically raise orders to produce these components if manufactured components are in short supply.) and [Distribution Requirements Planning](javascript:void(0);)Determines the need to replenish inventory at branch warehouses. A time phased order point approach is often used (similar to MRP logic) whereby the planned orders are driven by actual requirements by date.

  Configurable budgets relating to sales can be automatically pushed up GL budgets based on the same [special account](javascript:void(0);)A table entry that links a generic General Ledger account name to which the Pronto Xi applications post, for example 'IN' (Inventory) to an implementation-specific General Ledger account, for example '10111AA'. mappings used for actual sales transactions.
* Hierarchy budgets

  The hierarchy budget functions allow you to define and maintain budgets against any existing reporting hierarchy set up in the Business Intelligence module. Hierarchy budgets can be maintained per period, week or day, and the available budget measures include value, quantity, gross profit and gross profit %.

All budgets share a common and intuitive user interface that allows budget data to be export to Microsoft Excel, and reimported into Pronto Xi in an optimised manner. The budgeting capabilities also share the following features:

* detailed auditing of changes
* the ability to enter notes at different levels of the budget hierarchy
* a collaboration workflow to manage the maintenance of budget data by multiple contributors
* a comprehensive set to tools to generate budget data from actuals, or automatically adjust budget values based on a fixed percentage change or spread factors
