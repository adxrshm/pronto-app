# AT Mode

Auxiliary Trading Mode (AT Mode) is an offline POS redundancy solution that allows staff to continue processing normal cash and customer account sales when the POS terminal loses connection to the Pronto Xi server located at a different site, for example at head office.

AT Mode functionality provides:

* centralised monitoring of all terminals
* up-to-date data at the terminals, for example, the customer master or inventory master tables
* easy installation and configuration of POS terminals
* easy switchover to AT Mode in the event of loss of connectivity, and easy reconnection and data transfer when the connection is re-established
* the ability to incrementally update or fully refresh the master data at the POS terminal
